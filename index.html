<p>

<h2> Main Idea </h2>

Epsilon & Delta will hopefully be a series of mathematics workbooks for elementary school children. 
The goal is to expose children to mathematics (and some computer science) that does not require much previous mathematical 
knowledge but that is nevertheless generally taught much later in their education. 
Sets, prime numbers and functions are good examples. 

<p>

The books have two characters: Epsilon and Delta. 
The characters have discussions, such as if there is a largest number, and 
have adventures, such as building towers out of blocks and figuring out how 
many blocks they need. 

Each book has a special topic and story, and several sets of exercises. 
The content is cumulative. 


<h2> Age </h2>

The books are intended for children in first to third grade and will continue with them through school. 

<h2> Format </h2>


The first four books each have twelve pages of content. 
The books will be mailed each month throughout the school year. 
They are written by Brendan Farrell and illustrated by Natalie Chupil.

<h2> When to Start </h2>

The first book will be sent out in September 2022.

<h2> Parents </h2>

Parents do not need to have any math experience to work with their children on the books. 
Each workbook will likely take 1-2 hours for a child to work through, ideally spread over 
several days within a month. 
It will certainly be helpful if a parent works with the child on the workbooks and discusses 
the work with the child. 

<h2> Commitment </h2>

If a child sticks with it for several years, she/he should develop a familiarity and hopefully an 
enjoyment of mathematics. 
The focus is <i>not</i> helping children with standard school mathematics or preparing them for 
standardized tests. 
A child will need to stick with the books long enough to slowly accumulate exposure to the ideas.
